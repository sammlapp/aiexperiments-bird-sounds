## Bird Sounds
Thousands of bird sounds, visualized using machine learning.

The goal of this fork is to use or take inspiration from the google creative lab project to create a music-making tool using bird sounds. 

## About

Bird sounds vary widely. This experiment uses machine learning to organize thousands of bird sounds. The computer wasn’t given tags or the birds’ names – only the audio. Using a technique called t-SNE, the computer created this map, where similar sounds are placed closer together.

Built by [Kyle McDonald](https://github.com/kylemcdonald), [Manny Tan](https://github.com/mannytan), [Yotam Mann](https://github.com/tambien), and friends at [Google Creative Lab](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/). Thanks to [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](http://www.birds.cornell.edu/Page.aspx?pid=1478) for their support. [The Essential Set for North America](http://macaulaylibrary.org/guide/audio/essential-set-for-north-america) sounds are provided by the Macaulay Library. Check out more at [A.I. Experiments] (https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com).


## Front-end Installation

To build the client-side javascript, first install [node](https://nodejs.org) and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). Then you can install of the dependencies and build the files by typing the following in the terminal: 

```bash
npm install
webpack -p
```

## t-SNE

To generate a t-SNE with your own audio, check out [this repository](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/AudioNotebooks) from Kyle McDonald and the [Infinite Drum Machine](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/aiexperiments-drum-machine), which shares a lot of the same techniques.
